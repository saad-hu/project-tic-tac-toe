[Click here](https://saad-hu.github.io/project-tic-tac-toe/) for a live demo.

This is a multiplayer game of Tic Tac Toe. In this project, I learned how to use Module Pattern and Factory Functions. The gameboard is an object, created using Module Patter. Each player, is a dynamically created object using a Factory Function. The player objects are created when the game is started. 

Build using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
