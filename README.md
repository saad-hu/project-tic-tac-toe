## Description and Outcome
This is a multiplayer game of Tic Tac Toe. In this project, I learned how to use Module Pattern and Factory Functions. The gameboard is an object, created using Module Pattern. Each player, is a dynamically created object. These player objects are created using a Factory Function after the players enter their info and start the game.

Build using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
